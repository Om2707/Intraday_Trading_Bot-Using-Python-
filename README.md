This project features a sophisticated trading bot that leverages multiple machine learning models for intraday stock price prediction and order placement, akin to a Demat account.

Key Features:

Models Used:
XGBoost
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
Random Forest Regressor
ARIMA
Time Series Transformer

Order Placement:

Simulate placing buy/sell orders through the bot interface.
Ideal for intraday trading with predictions for the next 15 minutes.

Data and Indicators:

Uses Yahoo Finance for data.
Incorporates technical indicators like Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA).

The bot is designed for intraday trades, not for long-term investments.
Long-term investors should conduct their own fundamental analysis to avoid potential market manipulation.
